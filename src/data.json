        "infoText": "Maven is a top tier code school based in Barcelona. When looking for the best coding bootcamps, it is important to look for a school that would teach the most up to date technologies as well as solid computer science fundamentals. We teach software development at all levels. A beginner with no skills or experience in programming can learn to program in JavaScript with our ‘Apprentice’ beginners course. The course explores the key areas to learn JavaScript, one will explore the foundational concepts in computer science, and it takes one from not knowing how to program to a well-versed JavaScript developer. We have a coding bootcamp called Immersive that graduates mid to senior level Software Engineers. After an intensive 3 months at our bootcamp, graduates will become job application ready Full-Stack JavaScript web developers.",

          "description": "We teach you to learn how to code in JavaScript. It is the language of today and the language of the future. It is the only language that runs on both the browser and the server. Making it the only true full-stack programming language. Using many of its technologies, you will learn node js, learn react, and learn angular 2. Not only is it a language that is used for front end and back end technologies, a software developer could use it to build mobile applications. So if you were wondering how to learn programming, doing so in JavaScript would be a good place to start."
